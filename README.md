#Smores for Campfire
Mac desktop notifications for 37signal's [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com)

This is a very early seriously hacked together version of this. Currently here is what it does:

- Logs into Campfire and monitors __all rooms available to you__.
- If there is an active conversation going on in one of the rooms (new message within the past 90 seconds), the menubar icon turns red.
- If someone mentions your name (based on your name as seen in Campfire), you will get a Growl notification with the message.


##TODO

- Selectively monitor rooms
- Get better icons (don't want to use Campfire's icon, and the menubar icon sucks)
- Add more triggers to listen for
- Be able to start Smores on Login from within the app
- Sounds?
